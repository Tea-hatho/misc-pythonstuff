# misc-pythonstuff
A bunch of python stuff not big enough to justify their own repositories

- ImageToBraille
Two python scripts that convert an image and a video to a grid of unicode braille characters. This was originally made to use on the Bad Apple! PV so the result could be uploaded to a youtube channel. It was made over a day or two. I did some file moving so I don't know when I made it exactly but my PC says last modified 02/08/2021 at 01:44 so its probably around then.
Requires OpenCV and ffmpeg-python

- SokoBadXY
A version of the popular puzzle game Sokoban that is worse because the level generation code is a series of random number generators that is incapable of placing a wall in the middle of a stage. The game is played through a python console and was made is a single day. Precisely, it was 13/08/2021.
